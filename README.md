# Cosmos Proposals Demo

This website serves as a demonstration of the capabilities offered by the [subgraph-cosmos-proposals](https://github.com/pinax-network/subgraph-cosmos-proposals/) repository being developed by Pinax.

The subgraph enables efficient querying and indexing of Cosmos blockchain proposal data, making it easier for developers and users to access and analyze governance information across the Cosmos ecosystem.

Through this demo, you can explore how the subgraph can be integrated into web applications to create user-friendly interfaces for viewing and interacting with Cosmos governance data
